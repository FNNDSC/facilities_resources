Stata Center’s main data network was designed and implemented by CSAIL’s full- time staff of network and computing system managers, known collectively as T!G (the Infrastructure group). It consists of a state-of-the- art 10 gigabit, single-mode fiber backbone, Cisco Catalyst series switches, a fault-tolerant network topology, and 10/100/1000 Ethernet service via CAT6 copper cable to the desktop. T!G also maintains and supports a variety of centralized computing resources for the CSAIL community, including email service, web servers, DNS, DHCP, and many other common enterprise services. An 802.11g wireless lan is available throughout virtually all of the occupied space in the building. The computer vision group, in addition to having access to the resources described above, also maintains an extensive software library. This includes a range of generic public domain and commercial software: different compiler, debugger and software library packages (among others, GNU and Sun proprietary), Netscape, MatLab, Mathematica, and different security related packages such as S-key (one time passwords for access of the lab from outside), ssh and PGP (encryption). Graphics and image processing software packages include XGL, XIL, Open GL, Open Inventor, Data Explorer, Analyze, XV, IslandWrite, IslandPaint, and IslandDraw, and Adobe Photoshop for Unix systems.


CSAIL investigators also have access to a high performance cluster at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC), the state of the art computing facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. This resource provides peak capacity of 9,000 - 18,000 cores, peak memory of 36TB and a high-speed working storage of 1.5PB. The system is dedicated to life sciences research, and is jointly operated by a consortium of research groups from five universities and their associated partners. The system enables individual research participants to scale to the entire system for bursts of computation, but is operated so that all participants have balanced access on
average.


In addition to the resources available at CSAIL, Golland’s group maintains a 300-core cluster for computationally demanding processing. The group also owns 300TB of secure storage space that is maintained by the Infrastructure group. A recent addition to the computing cluster includes servers with close to 100 GPUs to enable acceleration of machine learning algorithms. The computing resources available to the PI will be instrumental for the proposed research, which requires extensive computing power, memory and storage for manipulating large data sets. Our budget includes computing servers that will be added to the cluster and used exclusively for training and evaluation of the proposed machine learning methods in this application.
